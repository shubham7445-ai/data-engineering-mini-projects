# Sales Analytics Dashboard (SQL + Tableau Ready)

This project models a simple sales database with Customers, Products, and Orders.

It demonstrates:
- Basic data modelling
- SQL joins and aggregations
- Data prepared for BI tools like Tableau / Power BI

## Tables

- `customers` – Customer info
- `products` – Product catalog
- `orders` – Orders with quantity and price

## How to Use

1. Run `sql/create_tables.sql` in MySQL (or any SQL database).
2. Run `sql/sample_queries.sql` to get:
   - Total revenue
   - Revenue by month
   - Top products
   - Revenue by region
3. Connect this database to any BI tool (e.g., Tableau) and build charts from the queries.
